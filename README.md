# Description

In the jupyter notebook we extract data from excel files and and clean it using pandas, list comprehensions and regex

The cleaned data is exported as csv files in 4 seperate files

The png file contains a database diagram which explains the relationships between the tables. The .sql file contains the schema for creating these tables in a Postgres database.

Once the database is created in Postgres and the tables are created, the data can be imported. The campaigns.csv file should be loaded last. 

SELECT * FROM the different tables shows that the transformed data that was originally extracted from the excel files has now been loaded into a sql database.

Thanks to the instructional team, it is always fun to combine the different skills we have been learning and revisit materials from previous weeks.
